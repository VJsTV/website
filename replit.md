- `assets/css/vjstv.css` - Custom dark/neon theme CSS (~4090 lines)
- `_layouts/default.html` - Base layout with skip-to-content link
- `_layouts/vjs-detail.html` - Shared detail page layout for all collections
- `_includes/vjstv-footer.html` - Custom footer with floating sidebar, tip jar modal, mobile nav

## Accessibility
- Skip-to-content link (keyboard-accessible, cyan highlight)
- `:focus-visible` outlines on all interactive elements (cyan)
- ARIA labels on buttons, modals, navigation landmarks
- `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative icons
- `role="dialog"` on tip jar modal
- `prefers-reduced-motion` media query disables all animations

## Performance
- `requestAnimationFrame` throttled scroll handler for progress bar
- Passive scroll event listeners
- `will-change` hints on animated elements
- IntersectionObserver visibility gating on meter bar animation
- `preconnect` for Google Fonts

## Cloudflare Analytics & Dynamic Pricing
- **Secrets required:** `CF_API_TOKEN` (Read Analytics permission), `CF_ZONE_ID` (Cloudflare domain zone tag)
- **Backend:** `/api/analytics` endpoint fetches from Cloudflare GraphQL API `httpRequests1dGroups`:
  - Queries last 30 days of page views using dynamic date range
  - GraphQL query: `query { viewer { zones(filter: {zoneTag: "ZONE_ID"}) { httpRequests1dGroups(limit: 30, filter: {date_geq: "DATE", date_leq: "DATE"}) { sum { pageViews } } } } }`
  - Returns `monthlyVisitors` (sum of all page views in 30 days)
  - Includes 8-second timeout to prevent hanging requests
- **Caching:** 10-minute in-memory cache to avoid rate limiting
- **Frontend:** `vjsLoadAnalytics()` on sponsors/partners pages:
  - Fetches `/api/analytics` on page load
  - Updates pricing based on visitor multiplier (1x, 2x, 3x, 5x)
  - Shows "🔥 Based on X monthly page views" label above sponsorship tiers
  - Gracefully handles API failures by showing base prices
- **Pricing tiers:** Base prices (Title: $5K, Tech: $2.5K, Creative: $1.5K, Equipment: $1K) × visitor multiplier
- **Stats bar:** 97 community members, 50 countries (static), 23 events (static), unique visitors (removed from display)
- **Testing:** API returns `{"monthlyVisitors": number, "cached": false/true}` on success; fallback on timeout/error

## Submission System (GitHub Issues Integration)
- **Unified Server:** `api/server.js` — Express on port 5000 serves both static site (`_site/`) and API endpoints
- **Jekyll Build:** Express runs `jekyll build --watch --incremental` automatically; no separate Jekyll server needed
- **Frontend:** `submit/index.html` — form POSTs to `/api/submit` (same origin, no CORS issues)
- **GitHub Integration:** Uses Replit Connectors SDK (`@replit/connectors-sdk`) for authenticated GitHub API calls
- **Repo:** `VJsTV/website` — submissions create Issues with labels (`submission`, type-based)
- **Workflow:** Form submission → Express API → GitHub Issue created with Jekyll front matter
- **Approval:** Add `approved` label in GitHub Issues → can trigger GitHub Action to auto-generate `_projects/*.md`
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/submit` — create submission Issue (rate limited: 3/5min)
  - `POST /api/report` — report issue on any detail page (rate limited: 3/2min)
  - `POST /api/partner` — partnership enquiry from sponsors page (rate limited: 3/5min, label: `partnership`)
  - `GET /api/analytics` — fetch monthly visitors from Cloudflare (10-min cache); pricing multiplier: 1x (<10K), 2x (10K-50K), 3x (50K-200K), 5x (200K+)
  - `GET /api/projects` — fetch approved Issues
  - `GET /api/health` — health check
- **Report Feature:** "Report an Issue" button in sidebar of all `vjs-detail` pages + footer of every page; modal → creates GitHub Issue with `report` label
- **Partnership Form:** "Send Partnership Enquiry" on `/sponsors/` and "Get in Touch" on `/partners/` both POST to `/api/partner` → creates GitHub Issue titled "SPONSORS & PARTNERS – {company}" with `partnership` label
- **Security:** Honeypot spam field, per-IP rate limiting, input trimming/length caps, 50KB body limit

## Development
```
node api/server.js  # Single server: Express (API + static) + Jekyll watch on port 5000
```

## Deployment
- Target: static
- Build: `bundle exec jekyll build`
- Public directory: `_site`

## Adding Content
Each collection item uses `layout: vjs-detail` and has specific frontmatter fields. See existing items in each collection directory for examples.

### Artist Images
Artists can include a profile image by adding an `image:` field to their frontmatter:
```yaml
image: "/assets/images/artists/artist-name.jpg"
```

If no image is provided, the artist card displays a neon initial badge instead. To add artist images:
1. Upload image files to `assets/images/artists/` (JPEG or PNG recommended)
2. Add `image:` field pointing to the file path
3. The component automatically displays the image on the artists directory page

## Hero Section Architecture
- `index.html` contains the hero player, sidebar, and chyron bar
- `VJS_PROJECT_POOL` array is built at Jekyll build time from all projects with Vimeo IDs
- Fisher-Yates shuffle picks 8 random projects for the sidebar on each page load
- First pick is stored in `window._vjsFirstPick` and applied to the chyron AFTER chyron DOM elements exist (avoids null reference race condition)
- `heroPlay(card)` updates the player/chyron when sidebar cards are clicked; guards against missing location data

## Vimeo Thumbnail Loading
- Global loader in `_includes/core/scripts/scripts.html` uses oEmbed API: `vimeo.com/api/oembed.json?url=...&width=480`
- Elements with `class="vjs-vimeo-thumb" data-vimeo="ID"` auto-load thumbnails
- Failed fetches clear the loaded flag to allow retries
- Hero sidebar cards load thumbnails via the same oEmbed API at 200px width

## Excluded Legacy Files
The original Snowlake theme demo content (portfolios, blogs, shop, services, etc.) is excluded via `_config.yml` exclude list but remains in the repo for reference. Also excluded: `.local`, `.replit`, `attached_assets`, `node_modules`, `vendor`, `replit.md` to prevent Jekyll watch loops.
